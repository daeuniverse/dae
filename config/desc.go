Available functions: domain, sip, dip, sport, dport, ipversion, l4proto, pname, mac.
Available keys in domain function: suffix, keyword, regex, full. No key indicates suffix.
domain: Match domain.
sip: Match source IP. CIDR format is also supported.
dip: Match dest IP. CIDR format is also supported.
sport: Match source port. Range like 8000-9000 is also supported.

	"dial_mode": `Optional values of dial_mode are:
1. "ip". Dial proxy using the IP from DNS directly. This allows your ipv4, ipv6 to choose the optimal path respectively, and makes the IP version requested by the application meet expectations. For example, if you use curl -4 ip.sb, you will request IPv4 via proxy and get a IPv4 echo. And curl -6 ip.sb will request IPv6. This may solve some wierd full-cone problem if your are be your node support that.
2. "domain". Dial proxy using the domain from sniffing. This will relieve DNS pollution problem to a great extent if have impure DNS environment. Generally, this mode brings faster proxy response time because proxy will re-resolve the domain in remote, thus get better IP result to connect. This policy does not impact routing. That is to say, domain rewrite will be after traffic split of routing and dae will not re-route it.
3. "domain+". Based on domain mode but do not check the authenticity of sniffing result. It is useful for users whose DNS requests do not go through dae but want faster proxy response time. Notice that, if DNS requests do not go through dae, dae cannot split traffic by domain.`,
