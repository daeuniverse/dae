# Contribute

If you want to contribute to a project and make it better, your help is very welcome. Contributing is also a great way to learn more about social coding on GitHub, new technologies and their ecosystems and how to make constructive, helpful bug reports, feature requests and the noblest of all contributions: a good, clean pull request.

## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

If you have found a `bug` or have a `feature request`, please use the search first in case a similar issue already exists. If not, please create an [issue](https://github.com/daeuniverse/dae/issues/new) in this repository

## Code

If you would like to fix a bug or implement a feature, please `fork` the repository and `create a Pull Request`.

Before you start any Pull Request, `it is recommended that you create an issue` to discuss first if you have any doubts about requirement or implementation. That way you can be sure that the maintainer(s) agree on what to change and how, and you can hopefully get a quick merge afterwards.

`Pull Requests` can only be merged once all status checks are green.

## Pre-commit Hook

This repo uses [pre-commit hook](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks) to apply linting check prior to writing commit to local Git history. To set up pre-commit, do the followings:

```bash
# install pre-commit
pip3 install pre-commit
# install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

## How to make a clean pull request

- Create a `personal fork` of the project on GitHub.
- Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on GitHub is called `origin`.
- Add the original repository as a remote called `upstream`.
- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
- Create a new branch to work on! Branch from `develop` if it exists, else from `master`.
- Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
- Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.
- If the project has tests run them!
- Write or adapt tests as needed.
- Add or change the documentation as needed.
- Squash your commits into a single commit with Git's [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase). Create a new branch if necessary.
- Push your branch to your fork on GitHub, the remote `origin`.
- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's `develop` branch if there is one, else go for `master`!
- Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from `upstream` to your local repo and delete
  your extra branch(es).

And last but not least: Always write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code â€“ not what you did to the code.

## Re-requesting a review

Please do not ping your reviewer(s) by mentioning them in a new comment. Instead, use the re-request review functionality. Read more about this in the [GitHub docs, Re-requesting a review](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request#re-requesting-a-review).
