# Run Dae as a Daemon Service

[systemd](https://wiki.debian.org/systemd) allows you to create and manage services in extremely powerful and flexible ways.

> **Note**
> If your distribution's service manager is provided by systemd.

Dae can be running as a daemon(systemd) service so that it can run at boot.

## Prerequisites

> **Note**
> The config file is recommended to save under `/etc/dae`

Download the sample config file

```bash
mkdir -p /etc/dae
curl -L -o /etc/dae/config.dae https://github.com/v2rayA/dae/raw/main/example.dae

```bash
# download the sample systemd.service
sudo curl -L -o /etc/systemd/system/dae.service https://github.com/v2rayA/dae/raw/main/install/dae.service

# reload and restart daemon to take effect
