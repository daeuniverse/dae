    # Optional values of dial_mode are:
    # 1. "ip". Dial proxy using the IP from DNS directly. This allows your ipv4, ipv6 to choose the optimal path
    #       respectively, and makes the IP version requested by the application meet expectations. For example, if you
    #       use curl -4 ip.sb, you will request IPv4 via proxy and get a IPv4 echo. And curl -6 ip.sb will request IPv6.
    #       This may solve some wierd full-cone problem if your are be your node support that.
    # 2. "domain". Dial proxy using the domain from sniffing. This will relieve DNS pollution problem to a great extent
    #       if have impure DNS environment. Generally, this mode brings faster proxy response time because proxy will
    #       re-resolve the domain in remote, thus get better IP result to connect. This policy does not impact routing.
    #       That is to say, domain rewrite will be after traffic split of routing and dae will not re-route it.
    # 3. "domain+". Based on domain mode but do not check the authenticity of sniffing result. It is useful for users
    #       whose DNS requests do not go through dae but want faster proxy response time. Notice that, if DNS requests
    #       do not go through dae, dae cannot split traffic by domain.

    # let them "must_direct", which makes DNS requests not redirect back to dae again.
